1) Configure Username and email address  :: Local records - Who gets credits for your work in history

git config --global user.name "Chirag OPS Engineer"
git config --global user.email "chirag01jain@gmail.com"

# git config --global color-ui true           --> Pretty command line colors.

2) Create your first git project

git init chefRecipes
# Above will create a directory name chefRecipes
cd chefRecipes
vim recipe1.rb
git add recipe1.rb
# Above will add the file to version control, means we want above file to participate in next commit - http://screencast.com/t/8PWTiFLADg
git commit -m"My first commit"
# Above means recording the state of file at the given point in time using commit, -m= message description

#### Repeat, create new files, add files to version control, commit to record the states to historical events ####
## Help ::

git help
git help config
git status -> To check what changes since your last commit.
git log -> Get timeline history

Note: If directory is already there, simply type:: git init (It will create repo - .git in same directory).
