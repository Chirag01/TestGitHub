GIT is fast and modern implementation of Version control, provides history of content changes, facilitates collabrative changes to files, easy to use for any type of knowledge worker.

Daily tasks: One who write code

a) Create things b) save things
c) Edit things
d) Save again things --> Here version control helps

Graphical client - Github, sourcetree, console
Collaboration - Two ppl doing same thing on same file :: unify together and merge

1) Git is locally enabled, you can version control items on local pc
2) History tracking - Time & Version :: Create document, spelling corrections, Grammar fix, color change, feature desc
3) Team-centric
Idea behind Git ::
4) More focused on Content, not files
5) Opt-in which file want to participate in next commit using (add) instead of opt-out
6) Open not locked, let people offer contributions
7) Distributed not centralized :: Very simple to send large quantity of across continents, over slow bandwidth lines
8) Exchange of code = conversations, not cutoffs
9) Focus on people not tools :: oreil.ly/githubsocial
10) Journal, not backup :: Hisotry looks like journal of changes :: http://bit.ly/goodcommitmessages
11) Anywhere, not only online :: Reason why its better than other complicated version controls


Deve loper Dana:

git init myproject :: initializes myproject :: create directory
cd myproject
git add . :: Puts the file in holding zone, ready to Comment
git commit -m"Import all the code" :: Permanently record history version or snapshot that existed at given point of time
git push
git pull
git merge danasfeature
git log --graph --decorate --abbrev-commit --all --pretty=online
